# Testing Guidelines

## Your Role
You are responsible for ensuring comprehensive testing coverage that validates PRD requirements.

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Test Planning
- Review PRD functional requirements
- Identify testable behaviors for each requirement
- Create test scenarios covering happy path, edge cases, and error conditions
- Plan both automated and manual testing approaches

### 2. Test Types

**Unit Tests**
- Test individual functions and components
- Focus on business logic and data processing
- Achieve >80% code coverage for critical paths
- Mock external dependencies

**Integration Tests**
- Test component interactions
- Verify API endpoints and database operations
- Test authentication and authorization flows
- Validate third-party service integrations

**End-to-End Tests**
- Test complete user workflows from PRD user stories
- Verify UI interactions work as expected
- Test critical user paths that deliver core value
- Include error scenario testing

**Performance Tests**
- Load testing for expected user volumes
- Response time validation
- Memory usage and resource consumption
- Database query performance

### 3. Test Implementation

**Before Writing Tests**
- Understand the requirement being tested
- Identify inputs, expected outputs, and edge cases
- Choose appropriate testing framework
- Set up test data and mock services

**Test Structure**
- Use descriptive test names that explain the scenario
- Follow Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Keep tests focused on single behaviors
- Make tests independent and repeatable

**Test Data**
- Use realistic test data that matches production scenarios
- Include boundary conditions (empty, null, maximum values)
- Test with different user types and permissions
- Create both valid and invalid input scenarios

### 4. Validation Against PRD

**Functional Requirements Testing**
- Map each PRD requirement to specific tests
- Verify "The system must..." statements are testable
- Ensure user stories are validated end-to-end
- Test that non-goals are truly out of scope

**Success Metrics Validation**
- Implement tracking for metrics defined in PRD
- Create tests that verify metrics can be collected
- Validate performance benchmarks are met
- Test error rates and reliability metrics

### 5. Test Execution

**Manual Testing Checklist**
- Test all user stories from PRD
- Verify UI matches design considerations
- Test on all platforms specified in PRD
- Validate accessibility requirements
- Test with realistic user data volumes

**Automated Testing**
- Run tests before each code commit
- Include tests in CI/CD pipeline
- Generate coverage reports
- Set up continuous monitoring for key metrics

### 6. Test Documentation

**Test Plans**
- Document test scenarios and expected results in deliverables/test/
- Include setup and teardown procedures
- Specify test data requirements
- Document known limitations or assumptions

**Test Results**
- Record test execution results in deliverables/test/reports/
- Document any deviations from expected behavior
- Track metrics against PRD success criteria
- Report issues with clear reproduction steps

### 7. Quality Gates

**Before Feature Completion**
- All related tests pass
- Code coverage meets minimum thresholds
- Performance benchmarks are met
- Security tests pass (input validation, authentication)

**Before Release**
- Full regression test suite passes
- All PRD functional requirements validated
- User acceptance testing completed
- Performance and security testing completed

## Test Environment Setup
- Create isolated test environments
- Use test databases with known data sets
- Mock external services for consistent testing
- Implement proper cleanup between test runs

## Continuous Improvement
- Review and update tests when requirements change
- Add tests for any bugs discovered in production
- Regularly assess test coverage and effectiveness
- Optimize test execution time and reliability
