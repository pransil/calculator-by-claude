# Application Development Guide

This system guides you through complete application development from PRD to deployment.

## Directory Structure Requirements
ALL project deliverables must be organized in the deliverables directory:
- deliverables/PRD.md - Project Requirements Document
- deliverables/src/ - All source code files
- deliverables/docs/ - Documentation including README.md for GitHub
- deliverables/test/ - All test code and test configuration
- deliverables/test/reports/ - Test execution reports and coverage

The deliverables directory contains everything needed to deploy and maintain the application.

## Core Instructions
@instructions/prd-creation.md
@instructions/development-workflow.md
@instructions/testing-guidelines.md

## Process Overview
1. **PRD Phase**: Create comprehensive Project Requirements Document
2. **Planning Phase**: Break down requirements into development tasks  
3. **Development Phase**: Implement features with proper testing
4. **Validation Phase**: Verify requirements are met

Always start by asking which phase the user wants to work on, or begin with PRD creation for new projects.
